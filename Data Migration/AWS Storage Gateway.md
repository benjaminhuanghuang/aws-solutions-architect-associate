# Storage Gateway
Provide on-premises applications with access to virtually unlimited cloud storage

To minimize latency, frequently accessed data should be available locally.

An AWS Storage Gateway volume gateway connects an on-premises software application with cloudbacked storage volumes that can be mounted as Internet Small Computer System Interface (iSCSI) devices from on-premises application servers. In cached volumes mode, all the data is stored in Amazon S3 and a copy of
frequently accessed data is stored locally.
